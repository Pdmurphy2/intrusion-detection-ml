Intrusion Detection with Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to develop a classification model capable of identifying suspicious login activity based on network session data. 
Using features such as login attempts, failed logins, IP reputation score, encryption usage, session duration, and unusual access times, the model is trained to 
distinguish between legitimate and potentially malicious authentication attempts. The primary objective of this work is to design an application that can evaluate 
login attempts and classify user activity as either normal or suspicious. This represents a supervised binary classification problem in which the target variable 
indicates whether an attack was detected during a session. The resulting model could be integrated into authentication systems or security monitoring platforms to 
enhance threat detection and support proactive intrusion prevention. Ultimately, this approach could provide organizations with a data-driven method for 
strengthening access control mechanisms and mitigating unauthorized access attempts.
